# EM algorithm for image segmentation
Simple python implementation of EM algorithm for image segmentation.  
*  ball_values.txt contains sample yellow ball pixel values.
*  EM_algorithm.ipynb runs EM algorithm to segment the yellow ball in the test image (001.png).
*  If you want to apply this code on your data, provide training pixel values which you want to segment in ball_values.txt (of course you can change the file name).
*  and run on your test images.
